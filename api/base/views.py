        Welcome to the V2 Open Science Framework API. WIth this API you can programmatically access users, 
        projects, components, and files from the [Open Science Framework] (https://osf.io/). The Open Science 
        Framework (OSF), is a free, open-source service maintained by the Center for Open Science [http://cos.io/].   
        
        The OSF stores, documents, and archives study designs, materials, data, manuscripts, or anything else 
        associated with your research during the research process. Every project and file on the OSF has a permanent unique 
        identifier, and every registration (a permanent, time-stamped version of your projects and files) can be assigned a DOI/ARK. 
        You can use the OSF to measure your impact by monitoring the traffic to projects and files you make public. With the 
        OSF you have full control of what parts of your research are public and what remains private. 
        
        BETA NOTICE: This API is currently a beta service.  You are encouraged to use the API and will receive support 
        when doing so, however, while the API remains in beta status, it may change without notice as a result of product 
        updates. The temporary beta status of the API will remain in place while it matures. In a future release, the beta 
        status will be removed, at which point we will provide details on how long we will support the API V1 and under what 
        circumstances it might change.
        
        ##General API Usage
        Each endpoint will have its own documentation, but there are some general principles.
        ###Filtering
        Collections can be filtered by adding a query parameter in the form:

            filter[<fieldname>]=<matching information>
        For example, if you were trying to find [Lise Meitner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lise_Meitner):

            /users?filter[fullname]=meitn
        You can filter on multiple fields, or the same field in different ways, by &-ing the query parameters together.

            /users?filter[fullname]=lise&filter[family_name]=mei
        ###Links
        Responses will generally have associated links. These are helpers to keep you from having to construct
        URLs in your code or by hand. If you know the route to a high-level resource, go directly to that
        route. For example, you can go to:

            /nodes/<node_id>
        rather than going to /nodes/ and navigating from there by id filtering. However, if you are creating 
        something that crawls the structure of a node, going to child node or gathering children, contributors, and 
        similar related resources, it's best to grab the link from the object you're crawling rather than constructing the link yourself.

        In general, links include:

        1. "Related" links, which will give you detailed information on individual items or a collection of related resources;
        2. "Self" links, used for general REST operations (POST, DELETE, and so on);
        3. Pagination links such as "next", "prev", "first", and "last", great for navigating long lists of information.

        Some routes may have extra rules for links, especially if those links work with external services. Collections
        may have counts with them to indicate how many items are in that collection.
